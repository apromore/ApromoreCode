Apromore Build Instructions with Eclipse Virgo

REQUIREMENTS
============

Apromore has been successfully installed on the following platforms:
- Windows 7
- Linux (specifically ubuntu)
- Mac OSX 10.8

Ensure the following software is installed:
- Java 1.7
- Maven 3.0.4
- Ant 1.8.3
- MySQL 5.5
- Subversion 1.6

MySQL is the default db that we support but we do have plugins for Postgres and Oracle but some extra setup will be required. The manager
application will need to be told about the change as well as the Assembely project. Also we only have sql scripts to create the database
for H2 and MySQL.

Check out the Apromore source tree from the Subversion repository at http://code.google.com/p/apromore/source/checkout


CONFIGURATION
=============

Edit the following configuration properties:

- Apromore-Editor/build.properties: fileSystemRootDirectory = C:/Development/Temp/signarvio-root (Or something equivalent in non windows systems)
  This needs to reference an empty directory with write permission

At this point MySQL isn't required for the builds at it now uses H2. To run Apromore after the build you will need MySQL setup.
Ensure MySQL is configured to accept local TCP connections on port 3306 in its .cnf file; "skip-networking" should not be present.



DATABASE SETUP
==============

Start MySQL
$ sudo mysqld_safe

Set the root password of MySQL to the default used by Apromore
$ mysqladmin -u root password MAcri

Create a user named 'apromore' in your MySQL database.
$ mysqladmin --user=root --password=MAcri create apromore

Navigate to the directory Extras/database/ and execute db-mysql.sql in your MySQL database.
This will create your database and setup the tables.
$ mysql --user=root --password=MAcri < Extras/database/db-mysql.sql


BUILD IT
========

* Change to the root of the project you checked out of SVN.
* Run the ant command 'ant apromore-pre-build'. This will upload any libraries that are needed and not in any maven
  repository and builds some support libraries and places all of them in your local maven repository.
* Run the maven command 'mvn clean install'. This will build the Apromore manager, portal and editor and all the extra plugins.
* Run the ant command 'ant start-virgo'. This will install, configure and start Eclipse Virgo, and deploy Apromore.


TRY IT OUT
==========

Apromore runs on all modern browsers, browse http://localhost:9000/portal
