REQUIREMENTS

Apromore has been successfully installed on the following platforms:
- Windows 7
- Ubuntu 12.04 (32-bit)
- Mac OS X 10.8

Ensure the following software is installed:
- Java 1.7
- Maven 3.0.4
- Ant 1.8.3
- MySQL 5.5
- Subversion 1.6
- Tomcat 7

Check out the Apromore source tree from the Subversion repository at http://code.google.com/p/apromore/source/checkout


CONFIGURATION

Edit the following configuration properties:

- Apromore-Editor/build.properties: fileSystemRootDirectory = C:/Development/Temp/signarvio-root
  This needs to reference an empty directory with write permission

- Apromore-Deploy/build.properties: dir-tomcat-webapps = C:/Development/Apps/tomcat7/webapps
  This needs to reference the Tomcat 7 installation

Ensure MySQL is configured to accept local TCP connections on port 3306 in its .cnf file; "skip-networking" should not be present.


DATABASE SETUP

Start MySQL
$ sudo mysqld_safe

Set the root password of MySQL to the default used by Apromore
$ mysqladmin -u root password MAcri

Create a user named 'apromore' in your MySQL database.
$ mysqladmin --user=root --password=MAcri create apromore

Navigate to the directory Apromore-Manager/src/main/sql and execute createDB.sql in your MySQL database.
This will create your database and setup the tables.
$ mysql --user=root --password=MAcri < Apromore-Manager/src/main/sql/createDB.sql


BUILD IT

Navigate to the Build-Tools folder and run 'mvn clean install'

Change the the Extras folder and run 'upload.bat' (Windows) or 'upload.sh' (Unix/Linux/Mac)
This will place jars in the build that are needed for the next set.

Change to the root and run 'mvn clean install'. This will build the rest and deploy to tomcat 7.


TRY IT OUT

Start up Tomcat.

Preferably using Mozilla Firefox, browse http://localhost:9000/portal
